            <p>
                He is currently in grade 1 at Southhampton and doing well in Maths and 
                English. Life Skills could use some improvement. It is a relief cause I 
                do not know how to judge where a child is.

            <p>
                He currently lives with his grandma in City Deep, which is 
                safer than Yoeville. Hoping to change the that in the future. 
                But that is where we are right now.

            <h2>As a Person</h2>
            <p>
                I think he is becoming a better person, trying things on his own. 
                Still caring and sharing but definitely trying the boundaries. 
                It's fun to see him try argue his way out of things.

            <h2>Faith</h2>
            <p>
                He has a tendency to try win arguements with scriptures from 
                time to time and keeps praying for siblings and a puppy. I 
                cannot speak on the Big Man's answer but mine is still NO.

            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <p>
                He likes playing Lego Batman and Robin with me, something about 
                a father and son in costume fighting crime. He also plays NBA 2k19 with me. 
                Since starting this he has taken on more single player games&#128512;.

            <h2>Physical Activity</h2>
            <p>
                He is still very hyper and loves to play wrestle and box. 
                I think that cartoon heroes are destroying his skills, he 
                would rather do a flying kick that a knee strike. But when he 
                connects its tough.

        All in all he is having fun and growing through it. We are looking into building a robot soon so 
        hopefully we will be sending out pictures of the results soon enough. I am very excited to code the thing. 
        I promise not to force him into coding. Though the chipset I have gotten for the purpose was designed for 
        kids to learn code. He will imput where he finds it relevant and i won't lie to him by saying daddy gets to 
        build robots at his work.
