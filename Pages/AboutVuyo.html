<h1>So about Vuyo</h1>
<div>
    <h4>School</h4>
    <p>
        He is currently in grade 1 at SCHOOLNAME and doing well in Maths and 
        English. Life Skills could use some improvement. It is a relief cause I 
        do not know how to judge where a child is.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Living Situation</h4>
    <p>
        He currently lives with his grandma in City Deep, which is safer than Yoeville. 
        Hoping to change the that in the future. But that is where we are right now.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>As a Person</h4>
    <p>
        I think he is becoming a better person, trying things on his own. Still caring and sharing but 
        definitely trying the boundaries. It's fun to see him try argue his way out of things.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Prayers</h4>
    <p>
        He has a tendency to try win arguements with scriptures from time to time and keeps praying for 
        siblings and a puppy. I cannot speak on the Big Man's answer but mine is still NO.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Gaming</h4>
    <p>
        He likes playing Lego Batman and Robin with me, something about 
        a father and son in costume fighting crime. He also plays NBA 2k19 with me. 
        I want to see him play more single player games and trying things on his own.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h4>Boxing</h4>
    <p>
        The boxing skills he previously had are eroding to more comic book styled fighting of spiderman cartoons. 
        Sometimes we do a little bit but I can see that he recent stray from the practiced forms I taught him have 
        led to rusty strikes and attempts at flying kicks. 
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>The Robot</h4>
    <p>
        We are exploring the idea of building a robot. So I am thinking of watching metabots with him, 
        plant the seed then furthur we can start small. I already have a chipset for it and am excited to code it. 
        Promise I won't force him into code, or make him code. The chip is made however made for kids to learn coding.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    All in all he is having fun and growing through it. We are looking into building a robot soon so 
    hopefully we will be sending out pictures of the results soon enough. I am very excited to code the thing. 
    I promise not to force him into coding. Though the chipset I have gotten for the purpose was designed for 
    kids to learn code. He will imput where he finds it relevant and i won't lie to him by saying daddy gets to 
    build robots at his work.
