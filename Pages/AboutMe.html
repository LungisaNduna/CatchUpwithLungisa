<h1>So about me</h1>

<div>
    <h4>Study</h4>
    <p>
        So I finished my learning at <a href="">WeThinkCode_</a> but missed graduation because 
        I didn't check my email. I do recommend it for others check out their site 
        for more information of how to get a free education in Software Development.

    <h4>Job</h4>
    <p>
        I am currently working at <a href="">Britehouse</a> as a Junior Software Developer in the 
        Public Sector department working with on projects for National Treasury and The City of 
        Joburg. I really like the job and seem to be improving consistently, I think.

    <h4>Life</h4>
    <p>
        Life is Job and Vuyo. Really I barely have a life outside of those two aspects. I have had some 
        interesting events to attend that some friends have held. Namely Yalezo's showcases, that's it.
