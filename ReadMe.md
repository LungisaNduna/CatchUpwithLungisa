Hey guys. Welcome to my attempt at doing something heart felt with code.
I've been terrible with keeping my family up to speed with where my life is so I have 
decided to work on a simple webpage to keep them up to date with where I am in life.

I am going to use this page as documentation I guess. Yah that is a good idea.

So here we go.
The first thing I wanted to do was to add some interesting styling for a navigation bar.
I am using the following tutorial for most of the first part

I like it and so might you.

First things first the reason I have chosen to do this is because: 
    1. My Mom asked me to inform some of my uncles about how my life is going.
        in fairness they helped to support me in becoming a Software Developer
        both financially and the other ways that count. My response to Her was that 
        I would do so as a coder would.
    2. I saw this interesting video this morning while doing my random coding video session. 
        Every morning I check out the first coding video suggested by YouTube, broadens my horizons.
    3. I really need to improve my github activity, It's one of my new years resolutions and goals.

Okay lets start coding.
If I randomly stop coding I might just have lost myself in the music playing, I'll try edit those out.
