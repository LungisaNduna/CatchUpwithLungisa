    <h1>Welcome to Catching Up With Lungisa.</h1>
    <p>My name is Lungisa and I am doing a virtual catch up session with the masses</p>
    <div>
        <p>I have created this site for two purposes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I wanted to tell people (mainly family) about how my life is going. 
                I felt that to tell people how far I have come as a coder I should do it with code.
                <span class="smallText">
                    This is primarily based on a request by my mother to communicate with 
                    some family members and an internal guilt that I have not done so in some time.
                </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                I like to develop more. This is both an opportunity to turn out a quick project and sharpen 
                my vanilla web development skills by using very few frameworks or libraries.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            So this site is very simple. There are some links 
            <script> if(screen.width <= 600){ "at the bottom"}else{"to the left"}</script> 
            which will take you to relevant information about my life and those close to me.
        </p>
        <p class="Notable">
            This is not a site I will be updating regularly so once you have been here it is unlikely 
            that there will be new things to see at a later stage. But I hope you got a lot out of it
        </p>
    </div>
