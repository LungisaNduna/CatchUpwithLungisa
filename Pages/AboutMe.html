            <p>
                So I finished my learning at <a href="">WeThinkCode_</a> but missed graduation because 
                I didn't check my email. I do recommend it for others check out their site 
                for more information of how to get a free education in Software Development.

            <h2>Internship &amp; Job</h2>
            <p>
                Last year (2019) I was included in the <a href="www.britehouse.co.za">Britehouse</a> Graduate Program. 
                It was a tough year filled with growth and development but I got through 
                it alive. Since then I have been permanently employeed, nice job.

            <p>
                There isn't much to talk about. It's mainly Vuyo and the Job, there are 
                a few things inbetween such as lunch and sleep. Sometimes I even get to 
                read books and play a game.
